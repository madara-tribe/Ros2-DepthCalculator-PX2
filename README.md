# Depth Calculator(PX2) through ROS2
This repository provides a pipeline to estimate the absolute distance from a single RGB image by using:
- MiDaS for monocular depth estimation
- YOLOv7 for real-time object detection

through least squares fitting repository, be able to convert predicted depth values into real-world absolute distances.
